2. **Add Officers**: Hire new officers with specific ranks and callsigns
3. **Update Callsigns**: Change officer callsigns with validation
4. **Promote/Demote**: Change officer ranks with permission checks
5. **Terminate Officers**: Remove officers from the force with database cleanup

### Permission System

- **Sergeant+ (Rank 2+)**: Can access management panel and assign callsigns
- **Lieutenant+ (Rank 3+)**: Can fire officers and manage ranks
- **Chief (Rank 4)**: Full access to all management features

## Database Schema

- `grade` - Officer rank level
- `callsign` - Officer callsign
- `status` - active/suspended/terminated
- `hired_by` - Who hired the officer
- `hired_date` - When they were hired
- `last_updated` - Last modification timestamp

### `police_callsigns`
- `id` - Primary key
- `callsign` - The callsign text
- `job` - Department
- `citizenid` - Officer's citizen ID
- `assigned_date` - When assigned
- `assigned_by` - Who assigned it

exports['qbx_police_management']:GetDepartmentOfficers(job)

-- Get officer information

## Localization

The system supports multiple languages through the `locales/` directory:
- `en.json` - English
- `es.json` - Spanish

## Security Features

- **Permission-based Access**: Only authorized ranks can perform actions
- **Location Restrictions**: Management panel only works at police stations
- **Callsign Validation**: Prevents duplicate callsigns and enforces format rules
- **Rank Hierarchy**: Prevents promoting officers above your own rank
- **Database Integrity**: Automatic cleanup when officers are terminated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Panel won't open**: Check if you're at an allowed location and have proper rank
2. **Callsign not updating**: Ensure callsign format is correct and not already in use
3. **Permission denied**: Verify your rank meets the minimum requirements
4. **Database errors**: Check MySQL connection and table creation

### Debug Commands

- `/syncpolice` - Force sync all police officers (admin only)
- Check server console for database initialization messages
